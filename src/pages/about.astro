      <p>
        I was born in El Cajon, California and moved to Bellevue, Washington
        before starting school. I grew up swimming and competed throughout
        middle and high school on both my high school and club teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from Bellevue High School in 2024 and now study Computer
        Engineering and Computer Science at USC, where I conduct research in
        AI for robotics and computer vision through CAIS++.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, I interned at Infosys in their Emerging Technologies division.
        I worked under the Senior Technology Architect to research and develop
        AI proof-of-concepts leveraging Federated Learning for more efficient
        and privacy-preserving model training.
      </p>

      <p>
        During that time, I traveled to Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and
        multiple cities across India. Travel sharpened my adaptability and
        reinforced that curiosity fuels technical creativity.
