      Analytical and experimental with a bias to action; I spot my conversations with humor, 
      and I thrive in high-stress environments. Whether helping launch a $27,000 fundraiser 
      for homeless families to drive a 300% increase from previous years or developing 
      gut-oriented biosensors for real-world use, I thrive where mission meets momentum. Last
      summer, I interned at Infosys through its InStep program, where I worked on 
      industry-oriented projects. I’m energized by people who think differently and build 
      boldly.
