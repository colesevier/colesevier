      <p>
        I was born in El Cajon, California and moved to Bellevue, Washington
        before starting school. I grew up swimming and competed throughout
        middle and high school on both my high school and club teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from Bellevue High School in 2024 and now study Computer
        Engineering and Computer Science at USC, where I research
        AI for robotics and computer vision through CAIS++.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, I got the chance to intern at Infosys in their emerging technologies division. 
        I worked under Chetana Amancharla - the Senior Technology Architect at Infosys - to 
        research and develop proof of concepts for new AI systems leverging Federated Learning 
        for more efficient and privacy-preserving model training.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I was there I got the chance to experience so many new places: I travelled to Sri 
        Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and numerous cities within India. I have learned that 
        travelling is not a hinderance but helps me to maintain curiosity and flexibility in my 
        research and development of new technologies.
